abstract = {INTRODUCTION The preparation of this report had two purposes. One was to present a catalog of seismic background noise spectra obtained from a worldwide network of seismograph stations. The other purpose was to refine and document models of seismic background noise that have been in use for several years. The second objective was, in fact, the principal reason that this study was initiated and influenced the procedures used in collecting and processing the data. With a single exception, all of the data used in this study were extracted from the digital data archive at the U.S. Geological Survey's Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory (ASL). This archive dates from 1972 when ASL first began deploying digital seismograph systems and collecting and distributing digital data under the sponsorship of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). There have been many changes and additions to the global seismograph networks during the past twenty years, but perhaps none as significant as the current deployment of very broadband seismographs by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the University of California San Diego (UCSD) under the scientific direction of the IRIS consortium. The new data acquisition systems have extended the bandwidth and resolution of seismic recording, and they utilize high-density recording media that permit the continuous recording of broadband data. The data improvements and continuous recording greatly benefit and simplify surveys of seismic background noise. Although there are many other sources of digital data, the ASL archive data were used almost exclusively because of accessibility and because the data systems and their calibration are well documented for the most part. Fortunately, the ASL archive contains high-quality data from other stations in addition to those deployed by the USGS. Included are data from UCSD IRIS/IDA stations, the Regional Seismic Test Network (RSTN) deployed by Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), and the TERRAscope network deployed by the California Institute of Technology in cooperation with other institutions. A map showing the approximate locations of the stations used in this study is provided in Figure 1. One might hope for a better distribution of stations in the southern hemisphere, especially Africa and South America, in order to look for regional variations in seismic noise (apart from the major differences between continental, coastal and island sites). Unfortunately, anyone looking for subtle regional variations in seismic noise is probably going to be disappointed by the spectral data presented in this report because much of the station data appear to be dominated by local disturbances caused by instrumental, environmental, cultural, or surf noise. Better instruments and better instrument siting, or a well-funded field program, will be needed before a global isoseismal noise map can be produced. However, by assembling a composite of background noise from a large network of stations, many of the local station variables are masked, and it is possible to create generalized spectral plots of Earth noise for hypothetical quiet and noisy station sites. },

abstract = {This book is an up-to-date introduction to univariate spectral analysis at the graduate level, which reflects a new scientific awareness of spectral complexity, as well as the widespread use of spectral analysis on digital computers with considerable computational power. The text provides theoretical and computational guidance on the available techniques, emphasizing those that work in practice. Spectral analysis finds extensive application in the analysis of data arising in many of the physical sciences, ranging from electrical engineering and physics to geophysics and oceanography. A valuable feature of the text is that many examples are given showing the application of spectral analysis to real data sets. Special emphasis is placed on the multitaper technique, because of its practical success in handling spectra with intricate structure, and its power to handle data with or without spectral lines. The text contains a large number of exercises, together with an extensive bibliography.},

abstract = {It is well known that local atmospheric pressure variations obviously affect the observation of short-period Earth tides, such as diurnal tides, semi-diurnal tides and ter-diurnal tides, but local atmospheric pressure effects on the long-period Earth tides have not been studied in detail. This is because the local atmospheric pressure is believed not to be sufficient for an effective pressure correction in long-period tidal bands, and there are no efficient methods to investigate local atmospheric effects in these bands. The usual tidal analysis software package, such as ETERNA, Baytap-G and VAV, cannot provide detailed pressure admittances for long-period tidal bands. We propose a wavelet method to investigate local atmospheric effects on gravity variations in long-period tidal bands. This method constructs efficient orthogonal filter bank with Daubechies wavelets of high vanishing moments. The main advantage of the wavelet filter bank is that it has excellent low frequency response and efficiently suppresses instrumental drift of superconducting gravimeters (SGs) without using any mathematical model. Applying the wavelet method to the 13-year continuous gravity observations from SG T003 in Brussels, Belgium, we filtered 12 long-period tidal groups into eight narrow frequency bands. Wavelet method demonstrates that local atmospheric pressure fluctuations are highly correlated with the noise of SG measurements in the period band 4–40 days with correlation coefficients higher than 0.95 and local atmospheric pressure variations are the main error source for the determination of the tidal parameters in these bands. We show the significant improvement of long-period tidal parameters provided by wavelet method in term of precision.},

abstract = {The importance of the reduction of atmospheric pressure effects becomes very clear when investigating seismic normal-mode spectra below 1.5mHz. The usual simple correction method consists in subtracting a term converted from local atmospheric pressure (pressure multiplied by a frequency-independent admittance) from the gravity record in time domain. Thus, estimating an efficient admittance is the key for an improved correction. Band-pass filters derived from dyadic orthogonal wavelet transform, having narrow pass-bands with good frequency response but without Gibbs phenomenon and causing no phase lag, are very helpful to estimate an efficient admittance, which is both time and frequency-dependent. Processing of high quality superconducting gravimeter (SG) records for the great Sumatra earthquake (Mw=9.3, Dec 26, 2004) with wavelet filters reveal the three very well resolved splitting singlets of overtone 2S1 with a single gravity record after correction with time-dependent and frequency-dependent admittances. We also observe all coupled toroidal modes below 1.5mHz, except 0T5, 0T7 and 1T1, with good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR); moreover, toroidal modes 1T2 and 1T3 are for the first time unambiguously revealed in vertical components.},
